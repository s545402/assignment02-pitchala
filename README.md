## Tirumala Swathi Pitchala
###### PARIS
#### PARIS Trocad√©ro at **sunrise**,__sunrises__ is a big open area, right in front of the Eiffel Tower, across the Seine river.The second point that makes it a good choice for Paris sunrise location is the fact that sunrise is the only time of day where this spot is empty. During the day, it gets absolutely crowded.
